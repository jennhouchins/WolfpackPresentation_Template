# Wolfpack Presentation Template for R Markdown
This R Markdown project provides a presentation template and css files branded for North Carolina State University. 

## NC State Branding

The project includes a wolfpack.css file which specifies all the colors and shadings as well as a university logo (img/ncstate_logo.png) pulled from the NC State Branding website [https://brand.ncsu.edu/]. This css theme adapts the metropolis xaringan theme and incorporates some additional formatting based on examples from Silvia Canelon's workshop on *Sharing your work with xaringan*: [https://spcanelon.github.io/xaringan-basics-and-beyond/index.html]

The wolfpack-fonts.css file loads fonts that are closest to the NC State licensed fonts using Google fonts APIs.

The project also makes use of some xaringanextra package features, such as:
 - use_clipboard for copy/paste of code snippets
 - use_tile_view for view all the slides and moving between them more easily
 - use_panelset for tabbed slide content
